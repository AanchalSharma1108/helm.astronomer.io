Now that you've installed the platform, you are ready to start using it.  You should:

Download the CLI:

`curl -sL https://install.astronomer.io | sudo bash`

Manage the platform with the UI:

https://orbit.{{ .Values.global.baseDomain }}

We have some guides available at https://enterprise.astronomer.io/guides/ and are always available to help.
